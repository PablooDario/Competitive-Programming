# Basic Knowledge of DSA

This is an introductory part to know the background of how some Data Structures and algorithms are implemented in Cpp, also to know how to sorted data structures with comparators and some basic DS's methods.

## Algorithms
- [Sorting](Sorting.md)

## Comparators 
- [How to sort different DS](Comparators/)
- [Sort a vector, Map and Set](Comparators/Comparator.cpp)
- [Sort a Map](Comparators/MapComparator.cpp)

## Manage elements in DS
- [Iterators](Iterators.cpp)

## Data Strucutures
- [Vector](Vector.md)
- [Deque](Deque.md)
- [Stack](Stack.md)
- [Queue](Queue.md)
- [Set](Set.md)
- [Map](Map.md)
- [BST](Trees.md)
- [Heap](Heap.md)
- [Priority Q](PriorityQ.md)
